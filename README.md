shox is a very simple and small implementatin of a shell and how it works.
Here you'll find parse, fork, exec and wait functions running as principals and another some ones.

Running conditions:
>> Commands must be on a single line.
>> Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
>> No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
>> Piping and redirection not implementeds yet.
>> All commands runs directly from your system path or current directory, but not cd, that is implemented on it.
